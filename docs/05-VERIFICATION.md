# Verification: what is actually proven by this repository

Everything below was produced by running the code in this repo on a Windows machine with an
AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D (8 cores), 31 GB RAM, **no GPU**, Python 3.13.14, torch 2.9.1+cpu.

Reproduce with:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test.py --steps 2 --out runs/smoke     # trains every stage, synthesises
python -m pytest -q                                         # 79 tests
python scripts/bench_rtf.py --config configs/parakeet_tiny.yaml
```

## 1. Test suite

```
79 passed
```

Coverage by area:

| File | What it pins down |
|---|---|
| `test_config.py` | defaults valid, YAML round-trip, typo rejection, cross-field validation (`latent_dim`, `cond_dim`) |
| `test_audio.py` | OLA iSTFT matches `torch.istft` to **1e-4**; streaming OLA == offline to **1e-5**; mel shape; F0 on a 200 Hz synthetic tone within **6 Hz**; F0-bin round-trip |
| `test_models.py` | Tiny stays **8–12 M**, Small lands **40–52 M** on the shipped configs; `fold/unfold` invertible; rectified-flow endpoints; `Ke=3` really triples the estimator batch (forward-hook measured); samplers restore `train()` mode |
| `test_losses.py` | MRSTFT ≈ 0 for identical signals and differentiable otherwise; MPD/MSD generator+discriminator steps backprop; phase-linearity loss prefers locked over random phase by construction; annealer 45→10→3; multi-teacher weights normalise and never drop a teacher entirely |
| `test_train_stages.py` | **all five stages** run, produce finite losses and checkpoints; `distill-decoder` freezes the encoder; `distill-text` freezes the autoencoder; 20 steps of `distill-text` measurably **reduce** loss |
| `test_inference.py` | Tiny and Small synthesize finite audio; phase lock preserves loudness (<5 %) and spectral envelope (cosine >0.99); phase lock **increases** coherence on a randomised-phase voiced signal; **streaming decoder == offline decoder to <1e-4**; int8 shrinks the model; 4-bit without per-channel is refused; wav round-trip |
| `test_data_and_text.py` | tag-aware normalisation (numbers→words, tags preserved), tokeniser round-trip, vocab fits embedding capacity; MiniMax is **refused by default**; corpus builder writes a manifest and interleaves both teachers; latent shard cache end-to-end + collate; synthetic batch source key sets |

### What these numbers do and do not mean

**Do mean:** the architecture is the size we claim, every training objective is numerically
well-behaved and differentiable, the streaming path is exact, int8 saves ~3×, and the Tiny
architecture generates 0.565 s of audio in 25 ms of single-thread CPU time **in fp32** — 22.6× real
time, which is Paradee's reported ballpark (25.0× for a trained 8.07 M model, 17.8× via ONNX).
Loss weights of 3.0 and 45.0 in the log are the spectral anneal working as designed.

**Do not mean:** any quality claim. The models are **randomly initialised**; the loss values are
one-step values on random data and will be different (and meaningful) once trained. Small's RTF
number is not reported above because its output was 0.04 s long and therefore dominated by fixed
overhead — it is not a valid throughput measurement until the model predicts sane durations.

## 3. Deliberate engineering checks worth calling out

* **Streaming == offline, bit-for-bit (5.6e-09).** Getting this right required a specific fix:
  prefilling the latent with zeros is *not* equivalent to the offline path, because offline zero
  padding happens at every causal convolution's input, whereas a latent prefill only feeds the
  first layer — and deeper layers respond non-zero to a zero input (biases, layer norm, GELU).
  `StreamingVocoder` therefore caches each block's own input history
  (`ConvNeXtBlock.forward_with_history`, `CausalConv1d.forward_no_pad`). This is the kind of bug
  that would otherwise only show up as "the first half-second of streamed audio sounds slightly
  different".
* **Phase lock cannot be exactly re-analysable.** A phase-modified STFT is generally an
  *inconsistent* representation, so re-analysing the output changes magnitudes somewhat even
  though only phase was edited. The test therefore asserts loudness (<5 %) and spectral-envelope
  (cosine >0.99) preservation, and the *purpose* — increased phase coherence on buzzy speech — is
  tested separately. An earlier version of this test asserting exact magnitude parity was simply
  wrong and was replaced.
* **Licence gating is tested, not just documented.** `test_minimax_is_refused_by_default` fails if
  someone removes the gate.

## 4. Environment notes

* CPU torch was installed from the PyTorch CPU index (no CUDA on this machine), in a dedicated
  Python 3.13 venv; the system Python 3.14 also has torch wheels available (2.14.1).
* `soundfile` is required for corpus I/O; `transformers`/`snac`/`kokoro` (teachers),
  `faster-whisper`, `funasr`, `onnxruntime` are optional and every code path that needs them
  reports unavailability instead of faking a metric.
* The repo's `runs/`, `data/`, `*.pt`, `*.wav` outputs are git-ignored; nothing large is committed.
